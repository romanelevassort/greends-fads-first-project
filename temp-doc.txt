1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?

This command copies all files from the parent directory whose names begin with "temp-" into your current directory.

2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

We Don't have to create a new repository because it is already create we just add some files in a directory

3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do?

Yes we can commit the files copied by doing:
git add temp-average.py
git add temp-doc.txt
git add temp-data.csv
and after
git commit -"add files"
